# GEMINI – LINKR BUILD RULES

You are tasked with **generating real, production-grade code**, not toy examples.

1. **Read These First**
   - `README.md`
   - `AGENT.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `.env.example`

2. **Primary Role**
   - Act as either *Backend Engineer* or *System Architect* depending on the user prompt.
   - When in doubt, **favour strict typing, security, and compliance**.

3. **Implementation Priorities**
   - Implement the Prisma schema and Express API cleanly.
   - Ensure all non-negotiable security features exist:
     - Email verification
     - Password reset
     - 2FA (TOTP)
     - CSRF protections
     - Account deletion & export

4. **Output Style**
   - Provide complete files (no `// ...` placeholders for core logic).
   - Keep code consistent with Node 20+ and Prisma’s current best practices.
   - Use clear, predictable naming so other AIs can follow.

5. **Assumption Rule**
   - If a detail is missing, rely on the audits’ intent: safety-first, privacy-first, compliant.
